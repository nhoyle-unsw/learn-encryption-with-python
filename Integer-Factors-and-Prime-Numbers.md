Prime numbers along with some fairly simple mathematics are used in RSA encryption to create the encryption and decryption keys. So, it is helpful to understand what integers are, what prime numbers are and some of their properties.

**Integers** are the entire set of **whole** numbers, both positive and negative (as well as zero): ... -5, -4, -3, -2 , -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

**Factors**. The infographic below shows how integers can be made up by multiplying other integers together. These are called the factors of the number. Factorising is where you ask yourself: I have an answer to multiplication and I want to find which two numbers were multiplied together to get that answer. An example is the number 20. It can be made up a number of ways: 4 x 5 = 20  and  2 x 10 = 20  and  1 x 20 = 20. So, the **factors **of 20 are said to be 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20. Numbers like 20 that are made up of multiples other numbers are called **composite numbers** because they are composed of other integers.

**Prime numbers** are numbers that cannot be broken down into other multiples of integers. Only 1 and itself are factors of prime numbers. An example is the number 5. You can not multiply two integers together to get 5, only 1 x 5 = 5. So its only factors are 1 and itself. This makes it a **prime number**. All the prime numbers in the diagram have a circle around them because they are special. They are represented as dots arranged into snowflakes to show how each one is unique.

You can see in the diagram that all of the non-prime integers can be made up by multiplying prime numbers together. This is what makes prime numbers so special, they are unique and can not be broken down into smaller multiples.

The properties of integers and multiplication are used in RSA encryption.

This infographic shows all of these concepts for every integer from 1 to 31.
